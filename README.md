# Golden Gate Investment Memorandum Generator

## Overview

The Golden Gate memo generator is an AI-powered platform that transforms decks, business plans, and call notes into first-draft VC investment memorandums. For founders, it provides insights into how VCs evaluate businesses and streamlines the process of presenting companies to investors.

- Google Cloud account with Vision API enabled
- Google Drive API access (for file processing)

### Required API Keys
Set up accounts and obtain API keys for:
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-4 access required)
- **Portkey API** (for observability and routing)
- **EXA AI API** (for market research)
- **Proxycurl API** (for LinkedIn data)
- **Google Cloud** (Vision API and Drive API)

## Installation

1. **Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/memo-generator.git
cd memo-generator
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

3. **Build Project**
```bash
npm run build
```

## Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```env
# AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
PORTKEY_API_KEY=your-portkey-api-key
EXA_API_KEY=your-exa-api-key
PROXYCURL_API_KEY=your-proxycurl-api-key

# Google Cloud Services
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./cloud-credentials.json
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"..."}
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your-folder-id-optional

# Server Configuration
PORT=3002
```

### Google Cloud Setup

1. **Create Google Cloud Project**
   - Enable Cloud Vision API
   - Enable Google Drive API

2. **Create Service Account**
   - Generate JSON credentials file
   - Assign roles:
     - `Cloud Vision AI Service Agent`
     - `Storage Object Admin`
     - `Drive File Access` (for Drive integration)

3. **Place Credentials**
   - Save JSON file as `cloud-credentials.json` in project root
   - Set `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` as JSON string in environment

### Vercel Deployment Setup

Configure these environment variables in Vercel:
- All API keys from `.env`
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` as the full JSON string
- Set function timeout to 300 seconds (5 minutes)

## Usage

### Development
```bash
npm run dev  # Runs both frontend and backend
```

### Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Deployment
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Architecture

### File Processing Flow
1. **Upload**: Files sent via FormData to `/api/upload`
2. **Storage**: Large files uploaded to Google Drive (bypasses Vercel limits)
3. **Processing**: 
   - Regular docs: Direct text extraction
   - Scanned docs: OCR via Google Vision API
4. **Analysis**: AI-powered market research and memo generation
5. **Cleanup**: Temporary files automatically removed

### Performance Optimizations
- **Context Management**: Intelligent content chunking for large documents
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent URL fetching and LinkedIn analysis
- **Timeout Protection**: Graceful handling of long-running operations
- **File Size Limits**: Client-side validation (10MB per file, 15MB total)

### Error Handling
- Content moderation checks
- OCR timeout protection (90 seconds)
- Network request timeouts
- Graceful degradation for failed services

## Limitations

- **Scope**: Provides 50-60% of final memo work; human review required
- **Model Limitations**: Subject to OpenAI model capabilities and biases
- **Market Data**: Estimates require supplemental bottoms-up analysis
- **File Processing**: 10MB per file limit, 15MB total request size
- **Processing Time**: Complex documents may take 3-5 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**413 Request Too Large**
- Reduce file sizes (< 8MB per file)
- Use fewer files per request
- Check total request size (< 15MB)

**OCR Timeout**
- Try with smaller/clearer scanned documents
- Ensure Google Vision API is properly configured

**LinkedIn Data Missing**
- Verify Proxycurl API key and credits
- Check LinkedIn URL format

### Debug Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=development` for detailed logging.
